tear down a game model for room if last player leaves; same for chat!

add eraser
UNBIND EVENTS
make sure artistOrder checks if player exists
don't check system messages as guesses
show game status updates in chat
add debug tools
check length of chat message. if it's longer than the longest word in lexicon, don't check for guess.
add rooms
